Project Title: 
Power BI Sales Dashboard: Analyzing AMP Business Performance

Project Overview:

This project showcases the development of an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI, designed to provide key insights into the performance of the "AMP" business (replace "AMP" with the actual business name if you can). The dashboard leverages a CSV file containing sales data, offering a comprehensive view of sales trends, profitability, and key performance indicators (KPIs) across various dimensions.  This analysis empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding sales strategies, resource allocation, and overall business growth.
